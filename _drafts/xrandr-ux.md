Can we make a small improvement to [xrandr][] command-line user experience so
that extra tools like [arandr][] (GUI for xrandr) or [autorandr][] become
unnecessary for many people? Yes, I think that making the `--output` option a
bit more user-friendly goes a long way, and lets me cover most use-cases with
just three shell aliases.
