I'm an experienced polyglot programmer, free and open-source software
enthusiast and regular contributor from the Czech Republic. I also cycle a
lot (road, gravel, urban, fixed-gear, unicycle), read books, listen to music
and taste beers.

If you're considering contacting me about a job offer, you should [read what
I'm really like](/real-me/) first.
